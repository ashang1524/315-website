        Welcome to the about page of my website. I'm sure you've already read a
        little bit about me from the landing page, but if you haven't, my name
        is Andrew Shang and I am currently a junior Computer Science student at
        Texas A&M University. I'm based in Austin, Texas but currently located
        in College Station, Texas. I've lived in all the major cities in Texas,
        so most places people mention I know about it or I've been there myself.
        I was originally interested in medicine until I conducted research in
        Computational Biology where I become more intrigued with machine
        learning and working with backend technologies. Recently I've sparked an
        interest with front end web development as well as UI/UX design. Most my
        time is spent learning new technologies and working on personal projects
        that interest me. Soon I'll learn Swift for native IOS development.

        Some facts about me. I enjoy being active. I've played tennis for 7
        years and have placed in several USTA (United States Tennis Association)
        tournaments. After tournaments started getting cancelled, I turned
        towards running. Living in Austin makes running more enjoyable as there
        are so many places to run or hike. I often take spontaneous trips around
        Austin just to run. River Place Nature Trail located in downtown Austin
        is my favorite go-to spot. If I needed to set the mood perfectly to take
        a run, I just surround myself in nature. Zilker Park also offers a mix
        of nature and city skyline if I wanted to feel immersed in the city.
        Even though I can't train as much as I would like to, one day I hope to
        qualify and compete one of the larger marathons such as the New York and
        Boston marathons. What's shown on the left is an overall statistic of my
        runs. Even though there's inconsistencies in my runs, anytime I can make
        time for it, I'll go for a run.
