            Ever since universities and schools across the United States
            suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the sudden change to online
            learning has severely impacted the learning experience for many
            students. Using the extra time at home to learn to code, we realized
            that it was harder to understand many programming topics without the
            aid of a teacher or professor. Many online learning websites require
            the student to rely on their own in order to understand concepts,
            while online tutoring websites require an expensive subscription
            service. After struggling to find a perfect method of remote
            learning, we decided to create our own tutoring service. Completely
            free of charge and built with all the functionalities required for
            the complete learning experience, CoderConnect is prepared to
            improve studentâ€™s programming skills - whenever, wherever.

        Proteins are essential building blocks of biological systems,
        functioning through sequence-structure-function relationships. Made up
        of several components, potential protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are
        vast in living organisms. The discovery of such knowledge experimentally
        or computationally can be costly yet inefficient. This research project
        aims to leverage available protein data and current machine learning
        techniques to predict potential protein-protein interactions. In
        utilizing 1D modalities of protein sequences, we aim at comparing the
        different sequence repre- sentations and their neural network embeddings
        to predict whether any two proteins interact as well as to compare the
        varying accuracies of various embedding networks.
